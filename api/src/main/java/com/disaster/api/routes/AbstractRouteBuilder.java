 * An abstract base class for defining Apache Camel routes with built-in support for:

 *     <li>Automatic timing of route execution using {@code intercept()}</li>
 *     <li>Route invocation logging with {@code interceptFrom()}</li>
 *     <li>Execution duration logging via {@code onCompletion()}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Concrete subclasses should override {@link #configure()} to define route logic,
 * and must implement {@link #getLogger()} to provide a route-specific logger.
 *
 * This class helps eliminate repetitive logging and timing logic by centralizing
 * them into a reusable route configuration.
